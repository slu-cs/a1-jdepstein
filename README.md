Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig to find the deadlines for registration and absentee voting in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the 2020 early voting dates.
    - There are some typos. A spell-check would be good to do.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The members list isn't navigational, so probably shouldn't be a nav (in index.html).
    - There shouldn't be more than one main on a page (in reg.html and abs.html for example).
    - The Emails page is outside the main navigational structure. Seems like it could be merged with the Contact Us page.
    - A consistent sub-menu on the Voting page, with active-link highlighting, would help visitors keep track of where they are.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The blue links are squinty against that background color.
    - The images are pretty, but they make you have to scroll around a lot.
    - The footer doesn't really seem necessary since the address appears elsewhere.
    - Some of the lengthier pages (Registration, Absentee) have inconsistent text sizing and alignment.
