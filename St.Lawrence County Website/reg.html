          <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-dark"> Choosing the Correct Form </h4>
          <p class="ml-2"> When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive
            the correct form. One form allows you to register for the first time, the
            other form is used if you've moved within St. Lawrence County and wish to
            notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain active voting status.
            Also note it can take up to a month for registrations from the DMV and other social
            service agencies to reach the board. Therefore your registration will be postmarked
            timely as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.
