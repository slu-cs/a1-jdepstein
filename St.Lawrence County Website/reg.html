  <div class="row container-fluid text-light ml-3 mb-2 col-md-8">
    <p> When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive the
      correct form. One form allows you to register for the first time,
      the other form is used if you've moved within St. Lawrence County
      and wish to notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain
      active voting status. Also note it can take up to a month for
      registrations from the DMV and other social service agencies to
      reach the board. Therefore your registration will be postmarked timely
      as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.</p>
